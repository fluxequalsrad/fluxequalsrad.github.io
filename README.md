# Data Science Portfolio by Simon Crouch

I've spent the last decade working in data analysis and business intelligence where I've produced reporting and insights for financial institutions. Having completed a Masters of Applied Data Science, this portfolio serves as a central hub for my personal projects and those that I've completed for friends.


## Projects

### Richmond Player Performance
[Notebook](https://github.com/fluxequalsrad/fluxequalsrad.github.io/blob/main/Richmond%20Player%20Performance.ipynb)      [Shiny Visualisation](https://fluxequalsrad.shinyapps.io/shiny/)

**Tools:** <br/> R, Shiny, Plotly

**Description:** <br/> The aim of this project was to determine which player from the Richmond Football Club could be considered our greatest player of all time. This statistical analysis involved using a comprehensive set of player statistics to rank players based on where their totals and averages fell on each metric's distribution. Data was collected, normalised and weighted before the ranking was conducted to ensure the accuracy of the results. Shiny and Plotly were then used to create an interactive visualisation, enabling the user to compare players based on the statistics that matter to them. 


### Hamish and Andy Product Web Scraper

**Tools:** <br/> Python, Beautiful Soup
